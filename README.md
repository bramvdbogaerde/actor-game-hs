Actor Game 
============

The goal of this project is to create an interactive
programmable game.

By this, I mean that the game should be, in addition to keyboard
and mouse, controllable by a live running REPL (Read-Eval Print Loop),
in the case of Haskell this would be GHCI.

The idea is that the system is build using actors, and that the programmer
can add actors to the game to change the dynamics of the simulation by
introducing newly programmed behaviour.

More to be announced.
